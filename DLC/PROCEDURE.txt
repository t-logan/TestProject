XML vs. HDF5 Run Procedure
==========================

1) Edit the DLC/src/main/java/dlc.properties file as necessary.

2) Edit the /HDF5/hdf5.ini file as necessary.

3) Export runnable jar files for GetFileSizes, ReadXMLFiles, StatsToCSVFile, and WriteXMLFiles into the DLC/run directory.
   Do this by right-clicking on DLC and selecting Export ...
   The run configurations are used to create executable jar files with all the dependencies included.

4) Empty the {target.dir} directory.

5) Delete all entries in the stats table in the DLC database.

6) Bring up a DOS prompt. Run dlc.bat in the DLC/run directory to execute all programs.

The results are stored in {target.dir}\stats.csv
